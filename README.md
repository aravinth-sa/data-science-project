# Data Science Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Science Project! This project aims to analyze and interpret complex data to help make informed decisions. The project utilizes various data science techniques, including data cleaning, data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model building.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations.

## Setup

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-science-project
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
